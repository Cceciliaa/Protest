# Protest
This is a web art project, expressing protest from the perspective of a social media website, aiming to alert people from indulging in the virtual world on social media platforms. For the project to display, the browser need to be set to be always allowing for pop-up windows.

The first part of this project appears just as a normal social media website, and all the buttons are embeded with dummy functions. However, when clicking on "like" or "share" or "subscribe" button, users will be alerted with a message, telling from the perspective of the website. When reaching the end of this webpage, users will encounter a "load more" button, which, when clicked on, will generate a seires of effects that seem like a web attack. For the effects to function properly, the browser need to be set to be always allowing for pop-up windows.

I collaborated with another student on this project. All the contents are original. We drafted the texts contents for the posts as well as the messages, and gathered the raw materials for the photos and background sounds. She later photographed all the pictures, and collaged the background sound, while I worked on the codes and established the effects.
